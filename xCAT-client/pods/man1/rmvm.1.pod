=head1 NAME

B<rmvm> - Removes HMC-, DFM-, IVM-, KVM-, VMware- and zVM-managed partitions or virtual machines.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<rmvm [-h| --help]>

B<rmvm [-v| --version]>

B<rmvm [-V| --verbose]> I<noderange> B<[-r] [--service]>

=head2 For KVM and VMware:

B<rmvm [-p] [-f]> I<noderange>

=head2 PPC (using Direct FSP Management) specific:

B<rmvm [-p]> I<noderange>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<rmvm> command removes the partitions specified in I<noderange>. If I<noderange> is an CEC, all the partitions associated with that CEC will be removed. Note that removed partitions are automatically removed from the xCAT database. For IVM-managed systems, care must be taken to not remove the VIOS partition, or all the associated partitions will be removed as well.

For DFM-managed (short For Direct FSP Management mode) normal Power machines, only partitions can be removed. No options are needed.

Output is similar to:

 lpar3: Success

2. To remove all the HMC-managed partitions associated with CEC cec01, enter:

 rmvm cec01

Output is similar to:

 lpar1: Success
 lpar2: Success
 lpar3: Success

3. To remove the HMC-managed service partitions of the specified CEC cec01 and cec02, enter:

 rmvm cec01,cec02 --service

Output is similar to:

 cec01: Success
 cec02: Success

4. To remove the HMC-managed partition lpar1, but retain its definition, enter:

 rmvm lpar1 -r

Output is similar to:

 lpar1: Success

5. To remove a zVM virtual machine:

 rmvm gpok4

Output is similar to:
